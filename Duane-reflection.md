* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Synching edits made to my local files with on GitHub. Mainly when to push edits to GitHub. Was it after every feature branch? Edit? etc.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
What it means to push to origin. 

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I was confused about the GitHub workflow overall. I believe I hopped into this GPS a touch early - it was before I submitted my work for week 1.

* What still confuses you about Git?
When the appropriate time to merge to the master branch is. Do I do it locally first? Or push to GitHub and then have someone else merge them?

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was a lot of fun! I had a lot of apprehension about it at first, but we communicated very well. Whenever I was confused (which was a lot), the guide and my pair were able to clarify.
