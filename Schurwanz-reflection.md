# Release 7: Reflect

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
	- I hadn't yet been introduced to fetch, and merging from the command line with a fetched repo from GitHub

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
	- Together we puzzled out how fetch and merge work together

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
	- what does "origin" mean in the "git push origin master" command? 

* What still confuses you about Git?
	- I would like to be more clear on what exactly happens when you fetch, and whether "origin/master" is like a master branch in the directory called "origin", and why you have to merge after you fetch. I have an idea but I'm not sure. 

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
	- it was good; I got a little past some of my nervousness about pairing, and I think we did a good job of conferring with each other when one of us had a question or was confused about a topic, and when either of us was in the navigator seat, the navigator was able to look up things to clarify questions about what commands to type, and together we talked out our confusion and arrived at some answers.
